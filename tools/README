This project uses a neural network for Visual Speaking detection based on VIDTIMIT model.

To install the project:
sudo -H pip install poetry
make setup
poetry install .

To build the neural network model:
Use notebooks tools/speaker.ipynb and tools/speaker2.ipynb

To run with the webcam capture:

cd tools
../.venv/bin/python renderer.py

Video file sample run:

cd tools
DEVICE=cuda DEVICE_ID=1 ../.venv/bin/python renderer.py ../data/lilir/twotalk/clip_PFq3PGRUSo.avi
